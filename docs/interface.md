The GUI opens on the dashboard, providing an overview of your entire setup. It includes key sections to help you quickly assess the state of your monitors and recent activity.

### 1. Summary Card
The summary card offers a high-level snapshot of all your monitors:

- **Overall Status**:
    - Displays an overall assessment (e.g. if all monitors are up, if some are down, if errors were encoutered...)
    - E.g. If all monitors are up
        ![Summary Card Up](images/summary-up.png){ width="600" }
    - E.g. If some monitors are down
        ![Summary Card Down](images/summary-down.png){ width="600" }
- **Monitor Counts**:
    - Breaks down the total number of monitors into categories:
        - **Up**: Monitors currently passing their conditions.
        - **Down**: Monitors failing their conditions.
        - **Paused**: Monitors not actively running checks.
        - **Error**: Monitors with invalid configurations or queries that failed to execute.



### 2. Recent Events
The **Recent Events** section provides a quick preview of all notable application and monitor events, such as:

- **Monitor Status Changes**:
    - Notifications when monitors transition between states (e.g., from "Up" to "Down").
- **Application Events and Errors**:
    - Alerts or system-level changes that may impact monitoring.


### 3. Monitor List
The monitor list is the core interface for viewing and managing individual monitors. Each monitor is displayed with key indicators and a graphical summary of recent results.

- **Status Icon (left)**:
    - Color-coded icons indicate the current state of each monitor:
        - **Green**: Monitor is **Up**.
        - **Red**: Monitor is **Down**.
        - **Grey**: Monitor is **Paused**.
        - **Yellow**: Monitor is in an **Error** state.
- **Bar Graph (right)**:
    - A series of vertical bars visually represent the results of the monitor's recent queries:
        - **Green Bars**: Successful queries.
        - **Red Bars**: Failed queries.
        - **Grey Bars**: Queries that have not yet run.
    - The bar graph provides an at-a-glance history of a monitorâ€™s performance.
