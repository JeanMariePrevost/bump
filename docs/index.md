# Welcome to BUMP

BUMP (_Basic Uptime Monitoring Program_) is a locally-hosted application designed to monitor the availability and performance of web resources. Developed as a learning project, BUMP offers a simple solution for tracking uptime, response times, and content validation.

While functional, BUMP is **primarily intended as a learning exercise and not as a replacement for professional or cloud-based monitoring tools.**
